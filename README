Check please tests folder,
There are two bad examples and good one

The point is you should contruct main query template
by including executable templates preparing temp tables 

Such executable templates are having input parameters as variables
and they are outputint into temporary table which can later be used 
by main template.

First it is very clear approach.
Second every such template is testable independatly! 

Bad examples are using in the worst scenario **include** for part of WHERE
In the other example parent/child inheretance.

Both are obscure. And used templates can be tested!
